The Rug command-line interface (CLI) provides users with the ability
to execute Rugs in their command terminal and to script the execution
of Rug using the shell.  The CLI provides developers with the tools
they need to create, test, and manage Rugs.

!!! note
    If you only plan on benefiting from Atomist capabilities through
    its standard integrations in chat, you do not need the CLI.
