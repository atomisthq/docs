Rug is the backbone of Atomist's features.  Atomist is about
automating away all the distractions from writing and operating great
software.  Rug provides the infrastructure to make complete automation
a reality.  The model that underpins Rug helps you automate common
tasks and react to changes in your development ecosystem.

This section documents the [runtime][] elements of Rug and Rug code,
called "Rugs".  Specifically, its development, its life cycle, and its
conventions.
