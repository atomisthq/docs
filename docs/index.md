# Introduction

We take a developer-focused approach to keeping your containerized applications safe. With our DevSecOps tool for Docker security that is currently in early access, security engineers and developers can:

- Improve security by keeping projects up to date
- Reduce noise and make security issues relevant
- Get clear, actionable info directly in GitHub
- Know the security impact of incremental changes
- Increase uptake of security fixes with fewer blocked deployments
