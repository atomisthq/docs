# Overview

Your software delivery machine is a service that runs automations in response to
events like pushes and builds. See [architecture][] for a high-level view.

The SDM:

-   is **event driven**: the SDM performs actions in response to events. The
    most significant event is a code push. The response to this event is defined
    by [goals](goal.md). The response to other events (repository or issue
    creation, for instance) is defined by [listeners](event.md).
-   uses **common APIs** across different automation scenarios. These let you
    write the important code specifying what you want to do, while calling APIs
    for the common work. For instance, the [Project](project.md) API lets you
    inspect and update the repository contents.

Your SDM is in TypeScript. Start with our code and add what you choose.

[team]: team.md "Atomist SDM Team Mode"

This section documents creating, building, and running an SDM, and details the
structure and organization of a typical SDM project.

To get started in [local mode][local], make sure you have:

-   [Git][]
-   [Node.js][prereq-install-node]
-   [the Atomist CLI][prereq-install-cli]

Before you run in [team mode][team], you'll need the
[prerequisites][prereq-prereq] page.

This page will help you:

-   create an SDM project
-   spin up your SDM
-   know where to add functionality to your SDM

## Creating an SDM project

The [Atomist CLI][cli] will generate a starter SDM for you.

```
atomist create sdm
```

For "Type of SDM to create, "Choose "blank" to start with an empty SDM, or
"spring" to start with an SDM that does useful things for Java Spring services.

For "name of the target repository" enter a name for your SDM.

For "target-owner" enter a name for the owner of your project. This corresponds
to the GitHub/GitLab organization or BitBucket project you would put the
repository under.

The "create sdm" [generator](create.md#generator) will transform the [seed][]
according to your answers. Because this generator operates in local mode, it
will create a project on your filesystem.

Look in \$HOME/atomist/_target-owner_/_name_ for the new SDM.

### GitHub

If you prefer the manual route, you can always fork the [empty-sdm][seed]
project on GitHub.

## Looking at the code

You can use whatever editor or IDE you like. We recommend [VSCode][] because it
is built for TypeScript (among other languages), it's a good IDE, and it's free.
With TypeScript and an IDE like VSCode, you get autocompletion that helps you
discover functionality in the SDM framework.

Run `npm install` first so that your IDE will see library code. In Node, all
dependencies are stored within the project, under the directory `node_modules`.
`npm` is the dependency manager that gets them there. The node_modules directory
is listed in `.gitignore`, so it won't be committed.

### index.ts

Start your inquiry in `index.ts`. When an SDM starts up, it looks here to find
its configuration. The `configuration` object has opportunities for many, many
configuration options. Click into the Configuration type or check the [API
Docs][configuration-api-doc] if you're curious.

The important part, where you're going to add to your personal SDM, is the
function passed to `configureSdm` in `configuration.postProcessors`. Unless you
change it, that function is called `machine`.

## machine.ts

Click into the `machine` function in your IDE, or open `lib/machine/machine.ts`
to find it. This function instantiates and then returns a
SoftwareDeliveryMachine([API docs][sdm-api-doc]).

Inside this function, add functionality to your SDM. You can:

-   Add [Goals](goal.md) to choose a flow to respond to code push
-   Add listeners to various other [events](event.md)
-   Add [commands](commands.md)
-   Add [project generators](create.md)

## Building an SDM

SDM projects are written in [TypeScript][ts] and run on [Node.js][node].
Building an SDM is the same as any standard TypeScript or JavaScript project.
First you install the project's dependencies:

```
npm install
```

then build the project, linting the TypeScript, compiling the TypeScript into
JavaScript, generating other required files, and running tests:

```
npm run build
```

[node]: https://nodejs.org/en/ "Node.js"

## Starting an SDM

There are a few different ways to start the SDM, depending on how you are
running it. If you are running the SDM locally, you can use the standard npm
`start` command.

```
npm start
```

If you are writing your own SDMs, you probably want a more responsive testing
environment, having the client restart any time you make changes to the source
code. This development flow is available with the `autostart` command.

```
npm run autostart
```

When you deploy your SDM to production, check the recommendations under
[Deploying your SDM][prod].

[prod]: sdm-deploy.md#production "SDM Production Deployment Considerations"

## Stop

Control-C will stop the client. Restart it after code changes with
`atomist start` again.

## Project structure

SDM projects are organized and behave like any standard TypeScript project.

### package.json

The `package.json` file defines the metadata and dependencies for the project.
In addition, this file defines the standard "npm package scripts", i.e.,
`npm run` commands, typically available in Node.js projects. Here's a summary of
the npm package scripts available in most SDM projects.

| Command             | Description                                                |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm install`       | install all the required packages                          |
| `npm run autostart` | run, refreshing when files change                          |
| `npm run autotest`  | run tests every time files change                          |
| `npm run build`     | lint, compile, and test                                    |
| `npm run clean`     | remove stray compiled JavaScript files and build directory |
| `npm run compile`   | compile all TypeScript into JavaScript                     |
| `npm run lint`      | run tslint against the TypeScript                          |
| `npm run lint:fix`  | run `tslint --fix` against the TypeScript                  |
| `npm start`         | start the SDM                                              |
| `npm test`          | run tests                                                  |

### lib

The `lib` directory contains the TypeScript source code.

#### index.ts

This is the starting point when you want to look at what this SDM might do.

### lib/graphql

The `graphql` directory contains `.graphql` files defining your [GraphQL][gql]
queries, subscriptions, and mutations. This directory is optional, as you can
define your GraphQL in strings within the source code. That said, it is
recommended that you define your GraphQL in `.graphql` files so you can realize
the full benefit of its type bindings in TypeScript.

#### lib/typings

The `lib/typings` directory contains the auto-generated TypeScript types for
your GraphQL queries, subscriptions, and mutations.

### node_modules

The `node_modules` directory contains all the project dependencies, as defined
in the `package.json` and installed by npm.

### scripts

The `scripts` directory contains various ancillary scripts. For example, this
directory might have scripts for building the project on CI, publishing the
project as an Node.js package, and publishing the project's [TypeDoc][typedoc].

[typedoc]: http://typedoc.org/ "TypeDoc"

### test

The `test` directory contains the automated tests for the project. Typically
these are unit tests written using [mocha][] and [power-assert][].

[power-assert]: https://github.com/power-assert-js/power-assert#readme "power-assert"
