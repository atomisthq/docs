## Dockerfile policy

Dockerfile Best Practices — Avoid common Dockerfile misconfigurations and usage that can cause security and operational problems.  It scans Dockerfiles checking for issues related to Docker's best practices for Dockerfiles. This uses hadolint/ShellCheck under the covers. Pin Docker Image Tags — Ensure consistent builds by keeping base image tag references in your Dockerfiles up to date. One of engineers, kipz, wrote a post about why this is a thing. The policy checks for and can ensure Dockerfile FROM uses pinned digest refs. No more surprises.Unsupported Docker Images — Detect when tags for official Docker images are no longer supported. People set tags and lose track of when an image is no longer supported by the maintainer, bugs and vulns don't get fixed.
