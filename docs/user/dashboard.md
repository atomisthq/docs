Atomist workspace.

[See and administer](sdm-list.md) the Software Delivery Machines (SDMs) in your workspace.

## GraphQL

Atomist constructs a graph of your organization's events, so that you can get the context you need to act on them. For instance, a push is linked to commits which link to people which link to chat users that you can DM. Issues are linked to commits that reference them.
