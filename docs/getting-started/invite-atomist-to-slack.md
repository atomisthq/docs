With everything in place to get started with Atomist, you can now
invite the Atomist Bot to your Slack team.  The Atomist Bot provides a
chat-based interface to Atomist's capabilities.

After you filled out the [Atomist Alpha][alpha] form, you should have
received an email invitation that looks something like the following:

[alpha]: https://atomist.typeform.com/to/MseQBs (Atomist Alpha)

</div>

To invite the Atomist Bot into your Slack team, simply click the
"Install Atomist Bot in Slack" button in the Atomist Alpha
invitation email.

Clicking the button will send you to a web page where you will be
asked to sign into your Slack team if you are not already signed in.
Provide your Slack team domain and click Continue.

the Slack sign-in.  If you have trouble signing in, check
out [Slack help][slack-help].

By default, the Atomist Bot will be named `@atomist` and will join the
`#general` channel in your Slack team.  You can invite the Atomist Bot
into any other channel in the same way you would invite any other
user: an `@` mention and invite, the `/invite @atomist` command, or
via the channel settings > "Invite team members to join ...".
