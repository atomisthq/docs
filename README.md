# Atomist documentation 

This repository contains the markdown sources for the documentation for
[Atomist][atomist]. You can find the current version of the Atomist
documentation at [https://docs.atomist.com/][atomist-doc].

[atomist-doc]: https://docs.atomist.com/ "Atomist Documentation"

The documentation is generated from markdown using [MkDocs][mkdocs].

[mkdocs]: http://www.mkdocs.org/

## Editing

Much of the documentation is hand-generated, so you can feel free to edit.

We use the [Google Developer Documentation Style Guide][doc-style] as our guide
and suggest the [Style guide highlights][style-highlights] for a summary.

See [below][build-serve] for instructions on how to test your changes locally.

_You are not required to test your changes locally in order to contribute._ Edit
right on GitHub, and let Atomist (our build automation) take care of it.

## Contribution criteria

Pull requests will be merged if they are better than the existing text. They
don't need to be perfect.

Here's how I define better:

-   Out-of-date information is the worst.
-   Emptiness is better than inaccurate information.
-   Any (accurate) information is better than none.

Additional links and information are great.

We will move toward a consistent style and tone after merging.

## Build and serve the documentation locally

[build-serve]: #build-and-serve-the-documentation-locally

Before you push changes to this repository, you may test your changes locally.

### Instant Development environment

#### Docker

You can build the docs with the following command.

```
$ docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD:/docs" squidfunk/mkdocs-material:5.3.3 build --strict
```

You can also run `htmltest`.

```
$ docker run -it --rm -v "$PWD:/test" wjdp/htmltest:v0.12.0 htmltest
```

You can serve the docs with the following command.

```
$ docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v ${PWD}:/docs squidfunk/mkdocs-material:5.3.3
```

#### VS Code

If you open this repository in VSCode, and you have Docker, and you have the
VSCode extension for remote containers, then VSCode will offer to open the
folder in a container. Accept that, and you'll have a development environment
with the right tools installed.

In the terminal inside VSCode, you can type

`serve` and then access your local, hot-reloading version of these docs on
localhost:8000.

`build` will build the site and test the links.

You may now skip the rest of this section. Continue with [including code
snippets from other repos][code-snippets]

### macOS

Initial setup (and re-setup every time python gets updated).

```
$ rm -rf ~/.venvs/docs
$ mkdir -p !$
$ PIP_REQUIRE_VIRTUALENV=false pip3 install virtualenv
$ virtualenv ~/.venvs/docs
```

Initial install of [htmltest][].

```
$ tar -x -z -f htmltest_0.13.0_osx_amd64.tar.gz
$ install htmltest /usr/local/bin
```

Initialize virtualenv in your shell and install dependencies.

```
$ . ~/.venvs/docs/bin/activate
$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Actually build and serve the site.

```
$ mkdocs build --strict
$ htmltest
$ mkdocs serve
```

You can then access the local site at http://127.0.0.1:8000/ .

## Styles

We use the [Admonition][admonition] extension to mkdocs. Here are the available
admonition styles:

-   summary tldr
-   hint important tip
-   check done success
-   attention caution warning
-   fail failure missing
-   danger error
-   bug
-   default (i.e., none of the above)

Items on the same line create a visually equivalent admonition.

## Releasing

When a push is made to this repository, the documentation is built by
[atomist-web-sdm][] and published to
[https://docs.atomist.services/][docs-staging].

If the staging deployment is approved, the site is "published" to
[https://docs.atomist.com/][atomist-doc].

[atomist-web-sdm]: https://github.com/atomist/atomist-web-sdm
[docs-staging]: https://docs.atomist.services/

### Updating dependencies

The `requirements.txt` file sets specific versions for the packages. To update
to new versions, you can use the following command:

```
$ ( cut -d = -f 1 requirements.txt > req.txt && \
      cat req.txt | xargs -n 1 pip install -U && \
      pip freeze -r req.txt > requirements.txt ) ; \
    rm req.txt
```

To update html-proofer and its dependencies:

```
$ bundle update
```
